# Quickinbox

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/DivinPrince/quickinbox)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE.md)

Self-hosted email for your own domain, running on Cloudflare Workers.
Get `you@yourdomain.com` with a full web client — no third-party mailbox,
no servers to maintain.

## Features

- **Real mail in and out** — the provider delivers straight into the Worker, nothing is polled
- **Threads** — replies group into conversations, quoted history collapses; conversations never mix messages from different domains
- **Attachments** — inbound files land in R2, outbound files upload from the composer
- **Safe HTML** — received HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe
- **Multiple domains and users** — per-user addresses, admin catch-all, unrouted-mail view; the combined inbox tags each conversation with the address it arrived on and can filter by it
- **Delivery status** — delivered / bounced / complained tracking
- **REST API, CLI, and MCP server** — send and read mail from scripts, the terminal, or AI agents
- **Hosted MCP with OAuth** — paste `https://your-instance/mcp` into Claude, Cursor, or ChatGPT and approve access in the browser; disconnect apps from Settings
- **Inbox tabs** — optional TypeSafe classification into Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates, Forums, plus a spam mailbox
- Light and dark themes

## Quick start

Click **Deploy to Cloudflare** above, or run the setup wizard locally:

```bash
bun run setup
# if bun isn't installed yet:
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

The button's deploy command applies D1 migrations (the `users` table and the
rest of the schema). If an older deploy left you with `no such table: users`,
run this once against that Worker, then reload:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --remote
```

The wizard creates the D1 database and R2 bucket, writes config, and onboards
your domain. Budget about 30 minutes — most of that is waiting on DNS.

The Deploy to Cloudflare form includes an optional `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` for inbox
tabs. Keep the placeholder to skip. `bun run setup` asks for the same key.

You need:

1. A domain you control
2. A [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com) account
3. Either a [Resend](https://resend.com) account, **or** the domain on Cloudflare DNS plus a Workers paid plan

## Updating an existing install

If you already deployed from this repo, pulling updates only changes the product name in the UI and docs. It does **not** rename your Worker, D1 database, or R2 bucket — leave those as they are (often `quickmail` / `quickmail-attachments`). Existing `qm_live_` API keys keep working, and `quickmail` remains a CLI alias.

## Choosing a mail provider

One provider is active per deploy, selected by `EMAIL_PROVIDER` (`resend` is
the default, `cloudflare` is the alternative). Do not point the same domain's
apex MX at both.

|                 | [Resend](https://resend.com)             | [Cloudflare Email Service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/) |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Outbound        | Resend API                               | Workers `env.EMAIL.send()`                                                    |
| Inbound         | Webhook → `/api/webhooks/resend`         | Worker `email()` handler                                                      |
| DNS             | Any DNS host                             | **Cloudflare DNS required**                                                   |
| Cost            | Resend free tier + Cloudflare            | Requires a **Workers paid** plan                                              |
| Delivery events | `delivered`, `bounced`, `complained`, …  | Accepted send is stored as `sent`                                             |

Pick Resend if your DNS lives elsewhere or you already use it. Pick Cloudflare
Email if the zone is already on Cloudflare and you want everything on one account.

## Manual setup

Only needed if you cannot run the wizard.

### 1. Install

```bash
bun install          # or: npm install
bunx wrangler login
```

Cloudflare Email Sending needs **Wrangler 4.123+** (older versions hit a
removed API path and 404).

### 2. Create D1 and R2

```bash
bunx wrangler d1 create quickmail
bunx wrangler r2 bucket create quickmail-attachments
```

Copy the printed `database_id` into `wrangler.jsonc` (replacing
`REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_D1_DATABASE_ID`), then run migrations:

```bash
bun run db:migrate:remote
```

To serve from your own hostname, uncomment the `routes` block in
`wrangler.jsonc` — the zone must be on the same Cloudflare account.

Then follow **exactly one** provider track below.

### Track A — Resend

1. **Verify the domain** in Resend (**Domains → Add Domain**) and add every
   record they show, including the apex `MX` — without it, mail never arrives.
   Enable **sending and receiving** on the domain.

2. **Set the API key** (create it with full access — send + domains + receiving):

   ```bash
   bunx wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
   ```

3. **Deploy, then create the webhook** (the URL must be public):

   ```bash
   bun run deploy
   ```

   In [Resend → Webhooks](https://resend.com/webhooks) add a webhook pointing to
   `https://<your-worker-url>/api/webhooks/resend` with the events
   `email.received`, `email.sent`, `email.delivered`, `email.bounced`,
   `email.complained`, `email.delivery_delayed`, `email.failed`.

4. **Save the signing secret** (shown once) and redeploy:

   ```bash
   bunx wrangler secret put RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   bun run deploy
   ```

While testing, a DMARC record on `_dmarc` is recommended:
`v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:you@yourdomain.com; pct=100; adkim=s; aspf=s`
(tighten to `p=quarantine` later).

### Track B — Cloudflare Email Service

The zone must use **Cloudflare DNS**.

1. **Onboard the domain** for both
   [Email Sending](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/email-service/sending)
   and [Email Routing](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/email-service/routing)
   in the dashboard, or with Wrangler 4.123+:

   ```bash
   bunx wrangler email sending enable yourdomain.com
   bunx wrangler email routing enable yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **Route inbound mail to the Worker.** In the Email Routing dashboard, enable
   **Catch-all** with the action **Send to a Worker** → this app. The catch-all
   is what lets users create arbitrary addresses in Settings. (This step is
   dashboard-only — the CLI can't set a Worker as the catch-all action.)

3. **Configure the Worker** in `wrangler.jsonc` and deploy:

   ```jsonc
   "vars": {
     "EMAIL_PROVIDER": "cloudflare",
     "CLOUDFLARE_MAIL_DOMAINS": "yourdomain.com" // comma-separate multiple domains
   }
   ```

   ```bash
   bun run deploy
   ```

Inbound mail only works on a **deployed** Worker (or `bun run preview`) —
`vite dev` never runs the `email()` handler.

## First run

1. Open the deployed URL.
2. Visit `/setup` — pick a domain and create the admin account (name,
   address, password). That address is both the inbox and the login.
3. Later users claim addresses through `/onboarding`.

Send yourself a message from another account — it should land within seconds.

### Several accounts in one browser

If you have access to more than one mailbox on the same instance, use
**Add account** in the account menu to sign in to another one without signing
out. The menu then lists every signed-in account; pick one to switch (up to 5).
**Log out** leaves only the active account and drops you into the next one;
**Log out of all accounts** ends every session. Each account keeps its own
session, so revoking one from Settings → Devices does not affect the others.

### Desktop notifications (optional)

Quickinbox can push-notify users about new mail even with no tab open:

```bash
bunx web-push generate-vapid-keys
bunx wrangler secret put VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY
bunx wrangler secret put VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY
bunx wrangler secret put VAPID_SUBJECT   # e.g. mailto:admin@example.com
bun run db:migrate:remote
bun run deploy
```

Users opt in under **Settings → Desktop notifications**. Don't rotate the key
pair after users subscribe, or they'll have to re-enable.

### Telegram notifications (optional)

Every inbound message can also ping a Telegram chat — useful for a mailbox you
watch from your phone without installing anything:

```bash
bunx wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN   # from @BotFather
bunx wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID     # from @userinfobot; negative for groups
bun run deploy
```

If the chat is a forum supergroup, add `TELEGRAM_THREAD_ID` for the topic to
post into — without it Telegram puts the message in General. Add `APP_URL` to
`vars` in `wrangler.jsonc` to link your install from each notification. Both secrets are required — leave either unset and notifications
stay off. This works on both provider tracks, and mail that matched no mailbox
is announced too, so a missing route is visible instead of silent.

Each message arrives as a single rich message — subject, sender, the body in
an expandable quote, every attachment inline with its size, and a link straight
to the conversation. That needs Bot API 10.1; against an older API the call
fails and the notification falls back to a text card followed by the files.

Delivery is fire-and-forget: a Telegram outage is logged and ignored rather
than failing the inbound handler, which the provider would then retry.

### Inbox tabs (optional)

Inbound mail can be sorted into Gmail-style tabs — Primary, Social, Promotions,
Updates, Forums — with spam in its own mailbox. The Deploy to Cloudflare button
asks for `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`; `bun run setup` prompts for the same key (or take
`--typesafe-api-key`). To set it later:

```bash
bunx wrangler secret put TYPESAFE_API_KEY
bun run deploy
```

Without the key, everything lands in Primary. Users can still move conversations
between tabs, report spam, and create custom labels in Settings. Classification
errors also fail open into Primary so mail is never hidden.

Mail that arrived before the key was set stays in Primary until the owner runs
**Classify** under Settings → Labels → Inbox tabs. The page updates after every
message; notifications are not sent for that backfill.

Promotions and Social do not send push/Telegram notifications. High-confidence
spam is filed silently.

## Development

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars    # fill in the provider you're using
bun install
bun run db:migrate:local
bun run dev
```

| Command           | Purpose                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bun run dev`     | Vite dev server (D1/R2 via platformProxy)                |
| `bun run preview` | Production build + `wrangler dev` (Cloudflare inbound)   |
| `bun run check`   | svelte-check                                             |
| `bun run test`    | Unit tests                                               |
| `bun run deploy`  | Build, wrap the Worker with `email()`, deploy            |

**Testing inbound with Resend:** webhooks can't reach `localhost`, so tunnel it
(`cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173`) and point a **throwaway**
webhook at the tunnel — never repoint production.

**Testing inbound with Cloudflare Email:** use `bun run preview` or a deploy.

**Forgot the admin password:**

```bash
bun scripts/reset-admin-password.mjs you@example.com newpassword --local
```

## API access

Any user can mint a long-lived API key under **Settings → API keys** and use it
as a bearer token:

```sh
curl https://your-worker/api/mail \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qi_live_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to": "you@example.com", "subject": "hello", "text": "hi"}'
```

`GET /api/mail?view=inbox` lists conversations. Keys are scoped (`mail:read`,
`mail:send`, admin) and only the SHA-256 hash is stored — the raw value is
shown once. Revoking a key takes effect immediately. New keys start with
`qi_live_`; existing `qm_live_` keys keep working after you pull this update.

## MCP (hosted, with OAuth)

Every instance is a remote MCP server. Add its URL to Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT,
or any client that speaks Streamable HTTP, and the client walks you through a
sign-in in the browser — no API key to paste:

```
https://mail.example.com/mcp
```

The consent screen shows which app is asking (with its real logo), exactly
what it will be allowed to do, and which of your signed-in accounts it will act
as. Approve, and the client receives an OAuth token scoped to that account.
Disconnect any app later from **Settings › Connections › AI assistants (MCP)**;
its tokens stop working immediately.

Tools: `whoami`, `list_threads`, `search_mail`, `get_thread`, `list_attachments`
(scope `mail:read`), `send_message`, `reply`, `update_thread` (scope `mail:send`).
A client that asks for only `mail:read` never sees the send tools.

Under the hood this is a standard OAuth 2.1 authorization server (RFC 8414 and
RFC 9728 discovery, RFC 7591 dynamic registration, PKCE S256, refresh-token
rotation with reuse detection, RFC 7009 revocation); public clients only. A
`qi_live_` API key also works as a bearer token on `/mcp`, so existing CLI
setups can point at it too.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` | Which server issues tokens for `/mcp` |
| `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | Endpoint list, scopes, PKCE methods |
| `POST /oauth/register` | Dynamic client registration |
| `GET /oauth/authorize` | Consent screen |
| `POST /oauth/token` | Code exchange and refresh |
| `POST /oauth/revoke` | Revoke a token |

## CLI and MCP (local)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DivinPrince/quickinbox/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
quickinbox login --url https://<your-instance> --token <key from Settings>
quickinbox inbox
quickinbox send --to someone@example.com --subject "Hi" --body "Hello"
```

The same credentials drive a local stdio MCP server, useful when a client cannot
do OAuth or you want several instances behind one server (see below):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quickinbox": {
      "command": "quickinbox",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "QUICKINBOX_URL": "https://mail.example.com",
        "QUICKINBOX_TOKEN": "qi_live_…"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`quickinbox` is the launcher from the install script (`~/.local/bin/quickinbox`).
`quickmail` is the same binary. Login once, or set `QUICKINBOX_URL` and
`QUICKINBOX_TOKEN` as above (`QUICKMAIL_URL` / `QUICKMAIL_TOKEN` still work).

Tools: `list_accounts`, `list_threads`, `get_thread`, `search_mail`,
`send_message`, `reply`, `list_attachments`.

### Multiple accounts

If you have inboxes on several Quickinbox instances, log in to each one. Every
login is saved as an account (named after the host unless you pass `--account`);
the first one becomes the default.

```bash
quickinbox login --url https://mail.alter.rw --token qi_live_… --account alter
quickinbox login --url https://mail.cursorrwanda.com --token qi_live_… --account rwanda
quickinbox accounts                 # * alter  https://mail.alter.rw
                                    #   rwanda https://mail.cursorrwanda.com
quickinbox inbox --all-accounts     # every inbox in one list, tagged [alter] / [rwanda]
quickinbox search invoice --all-accounts
quickinbox read <id> --account rwanda
quickinbox accounts use rwanda      # change the default
quickinbox logout --account alter   # or `logout --all`
```

Every command takes `--account <name>` (`-a`). `QUICKINBOX_ACCOUNT` selects the
default; `QUICKINBOX_URL` + `QUICKINBOX_TOKEN` add an account that always wins.

The MCP server exposes all saved accounts at once. Each tool accepts an optional
`account`; `list_threads` and `search_mail` query every account when it is
omitted and tag each thread with its `account`, while `get_thread`, `reply`, and
`list_attachments` find the account that owns the id automatically. Use
`list_accounts` to see what is configured. `send_message` uses the default
account unless told otherwise. Config lives in
`~/.config/quickinbox/config.json`; an existing single-account file keeps
working and is upgraded on the next login.

## Internationalization

The UI ships in English, French, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish. Language is stored
on the account (Settings → Appearance) and in a `qi_locale` cookie — URLs stay the
same. Email bodies are never translated.

Catalogs live in `messages/`. After editing `messages/en.json`, generate the other
locales with [General Translation](https://generaltranslation.com):

```bash
# GT_API_KEY and GT_PROJECT_ID from https://generaltranslation.com/dashboard
bun run translate
```

CI does the same on pushes to `main` (and on a manual **CI** workflow run). Set
repository secrets `GT_API_KEY` and `GT_PROJECT_ID` — never commit them. The
translate job opens a PR with updated catalogs.

## How inbound routing works

Both providers accept every address on a connected domain. The app then routes:

1. Exact match in `addresses` → that user
2. Else the domain's catch-all owner (admin) → that user
3. Else stored as unrouted and listed in the admin view

## Project structure

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `wrangler email sending enable` → 404 | Wrangler too old — upgrade to 4.123+ |
| Mail never arrives (Resend) | `dig MX yourdomain.com` must point at Resend; enable receiving on the domain |
| Mail never arrives (Cloudflare) | Apex MX must be Cloudflare Routing, catch-all must target this Worker, `EMAIL_PROVIDER=cloudflare`, Worker must be deployed |
| Webhook 401 | `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` mismatch — secrets are shown once; recreate the webhook |
| Webhook 500 | `bunx wrangler tail` |
| Attachments missing | R2 bucket must exist and match `bucket_name` in `wrangler.jsonc` |
| `database_id` errors on deploy | Paste the id from `wrangler d1 create` into `wrangler.jsonc` |
| Setup shows no Cloudflare domains | Set `CLOUDFLARE_MAIL_DOMAINS` and `EMAIL_PROVIDER=cloudflare`, restart the dev server |
